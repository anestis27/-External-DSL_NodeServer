This external DSL is built to ﬁt inside the web application development domain. More speciﬁcally, the node.js technology development domain.
The goal of the DSL is to automate the creation of a node server and its belonging conﬁguration parameters.
The DSL is meant to be used by a developer to create his own custom node server template with custom conﬁguration parameters. 
This will save considerable time, eﬀort and potential error search and debugging later thanks to the code generation.
This can also have the potential to save ﬁnancial resources.
